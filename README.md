## About Me
I work in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing, with a focus on low-resource languages such as Burmese.  
I am motivated to explore data-efficient and intelligent decision-making approaches, particularly in low-resource and socially impactful settings.  
My interests include applied machine learning, reinforcement learning, transformer architectures, and understanding model behavior in real-world contexts.  
I value minimal, clean engineering and reproducible research practices.
