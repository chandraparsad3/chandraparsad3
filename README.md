## About Me
I work in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing with a focus on low-resource languages like Burmese.  
My long-term interest lies in building AI systems for low-resource languages and socially impactful applications.  
I’m interested in applied ML, transformer architectures, and model behavior in real-world settings.  
I value minimal, clean engineering and reproducible research practices.
